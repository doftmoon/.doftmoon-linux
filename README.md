This is my repo for starting on a new system to get all my crap back.

It works using Ansible to manage all the installation and system-wide configuring.
I choose Ansbile bc I'm a human being and we are all pretty good at making mistakes,
so the Ansible will be some sort of failure-proof layer to installing shit and handling
system specifics.

To init the system simply run the init.sh script that will handle the Ansible installation
and running playbook.
Currently the whole setup is work-in-progress and might not work :3
